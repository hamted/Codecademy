/*
Write a program to find the sum of even numbers and the product of odd numbers in a vector.

For example:

Suppose we have a vector that is {2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9}.

Then the program should output:

Sum of even numbers is 12
Product of odd numbers is 27
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 int main(){
  std::vector<int> nums = {2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9};

  int even_sum = 0;
  int odd_prod = 1; //because anything multiplied by 0 is 0
  for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
    if (nums[i] % 2 == 0){
      even_sum = even_sum + nums[i];
    }
    else{
      odd_prod = odd_prod * nums[i];
