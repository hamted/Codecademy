/*
Build a Text Adventure
Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. 
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements 
which describe the project youâ€™ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, 
and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter 
a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
Create a C++ text adventure with the storyline of your choosing. 
The program should use your knowledge of C++ conditionals, logic, and loops.
*/

/*To be honest just making this up as I go
It says to use a paper but I don't have an active storyline so I'll update here as I make it.
Beginning, welcomes, asks for name. Generates a random number to choose between two storylines.
This means that each story is going to have it's own different codes.
I already committed so there is no going back, let's see how this goes...

-Actually, no I will be axing the randomisation, I thought about it and I think it's better if I focus on one and really build on it
