/*
Build a Text Adventure
Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. 
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements 
which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, 
and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter 
a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
Create a C++ text adventure with the storyline of your choosing. 
The program should use your knowledge of C++ conditionals, logic, and loops.
