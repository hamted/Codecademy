I'm learning C++ on Codecademy to increase my skills and learn a completely new programming language.
Preparing to take the course CSI 2372 @ uO this fall and I'm using this as an opportunity to get ahead.
I'm coming in open-minded and hopeful to add a really useful skill to the toolbag.
I'll be adding the projects from the modules as I complete them.
