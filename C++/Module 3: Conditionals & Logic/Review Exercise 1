/*
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

1. It should ask him what his earth weight is.
2. Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
3. It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

//Store response in planet var
