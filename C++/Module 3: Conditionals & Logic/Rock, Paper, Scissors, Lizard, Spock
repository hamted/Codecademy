/*
Write a rock_paper_scissors.cpp program that:

Prompts the user to select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
Instructs the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
Compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice and determine the winner.
Informs the user who the winner is.
----------------------------------------------
The logic:

Scissors cuts Paper.
Paper covers Rock.
Rock crushes Lizard.
Lizard poisons Spock.
Spock smashes Scissors.
Scissors decapitate Lizard.
Lizard eats Paper.
Paper disproves Spock.
Spock vaporizes Rock.
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.
