#include <iostream>

int main() {
  //the three concerned currencies
  double pesos;
  double reais;
  double soles;

  //amount in dollars
  double dollars;

//Asking for and saving the amounts of the currencies

std::cout << "Enter number of Colombian Pesos: \n";
std::cin >> pesos;
std::cout << "Enter number of Brazilian Reais: \n";
std::cin >> reais;
std::cout << "Enter number of Peruvian Soles: \n";
std::cin >> soles;

//1 Colombian Peso = 0.00024
//1 Brazilian Reais = 0.18
//1 Peruvian Soles = 0.28
  
  dollars = (0.00024 * pesos) + (0.18 * reais) + (0.28 * soles);

  std::cout << "US Dollars = $" << dollars << "\n";
}
